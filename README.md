# ToDos
The pure Spring-based DDD To-Dos project. 
All essential project's layers such as Application, Domain and Persistence will be developed by the spring agnostic way to
show how the separate application parts could be implemented regardless of the framework.
New and reworked DDD principles are implementing within this project at Domain layer.
